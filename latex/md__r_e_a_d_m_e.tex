Q\+: Speeduino, didn\textquotesingle{}t you used to be called something else?

A\+: Initial aim was for a simple DIY ECU for go-\/karts and the original project title was kartduino. As it became apparent that we wanted to extend support to larger vehicles, the name became a bit misleading. The important ideas though remain the same and the priority is still SIMPLICITY! The code is written with simplicity above all else in mind and all areas are well commented. The project can be loaded directly into the Arduino IDE and compiled with only a single additional library needing to be added. Where code is complex or low level, a high level pseudo code example is given to explain what is being performed.

Q\+: Arduino ECU,pffft, heard THAT before. Does this one actually work?

A\+: Yep! 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 cylinder engines have all run, fuel and ignition, off Speeduino.

Q\+: Target platform?

A\+: Arduino Mega (Or other ATmega1280 / ATmega2560 powered SKU) will be required. Standard arduino models are not suitable for multi-\/cylinder engines due to their lack of 16-\/bit timers. The shield board has been designed around the Mega and it is not expected that there will be a non-\/\+Mega variant.
