The Speeduino project is always looking for new contributors so thanks for your interest in this!

If you haven\textquotesingle{}t already, jump onto our Slack team as that is where most of the development discussion takes place\+: \href{https://speeduino.com/forum/app.php/page/slack}{\texttt{ https\+://speeduino.\+com/forum/app.\+php/page/slack}}

Here are some important resources\+:

All contributions should be in a working, compilable state. If your change does not compile cleanly it will be rejected immediately.\hypertarget{md_contributing_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Submitting changes}\label{md_contributing_autotoc_md2}
Please send a \href{https://github.com/noisymime/speeduino/pull/new/master}{\texttt{ Git\+Hub Pull Request to Speeduino}} with a clear list of what you\textquotesingle{}ve done (read more about \href{http://help.github.com/pull-requests/}{\texttt{ pull requests}}).

Please try to make each pull request atomic, that is, there should be a single defined intent or feature for the pull request. If you are adding multiple features or fixing different bugs, please split these up and submit multiple pull requests.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-\/line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
\end{DoxyVerb}
